        <p>
            With a solid foundation as a Process Assistant at Amazon, I successfully led a team of 100 associates, consistently achieving and surpassing operational metrics while prioritizing safety standards and customer satisfaction. My commitment to efficiency and process improvement was evident in my role, where I implemented lean and six sigma principles. Notably, I spearheaded a project at Amazon delivery station DGR6, resulting in annual cost savings of $150,000 through strategic labor time reductions.
